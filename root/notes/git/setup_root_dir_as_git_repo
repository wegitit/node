Pre-Req:
  git client
    yum -y install git
  ssh-key (go big on the bit count)
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C user@machine.tld
    note the fingerprint, e.g.: f7:c8:0e:c5:20:3b:2b:09:af:cf:e8:af:c9:58:af:c3 user@machine.tld

  Repo exists in github
    Required before git push to avoid:
      ERROR: Repository not found.
      fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    Not required: "Initialize this repository with a README"


Steps:
  Create local repo:
    Select and initialize the repo dir:
      cd /
      git init
  Add the URL for the remote repository to .git/config:
    git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/acct_name/project_name.git
      DO NOT USE:
          https://github.com/acct_name/project_name.git for the address
            due to ERROR:
              github 403 forbidden info/refs

      REF: help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/
  Create, add and commit README
    vi README.md
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "initial commit"

Update remote repo:
  git push -u origin master
    (u: set upstream - recommended by:
        github, on post repo creation page
        but not on help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)
